# Plotly (Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard)
## Overview of Project
> Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

1. ***Deliverable 1***: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

## Overview of ES6+
ECMAScript, also referred to as "ES," is a scripting language designed to help standardize JavaScript. This means that ES provides guidelines and rules for JavaScript to follow, such as how a function should be created to run correctly, also known as the **proper syntax**.

Because ES has provided standardization for JavaScript, it also brings updates to the language. There are updates to every major coding language that fix bugs, update code, and provide overall quality of life improvements for the developers. ES6 is no exception!

There have been many updates to ES over the years, though the sixth update was a major one. You'll probably see "ES6+" mentioned out in the wild pretty often; this is a reference to the "big" update (ES6) as well as the later ones. It's also commonly known as "ES2015" or "ECMAScript 2015." (It was such an important update that it's even known by its year!) There are quite a few different ways to reference this language, but we'll be referring to it as ES6, JavaScript, or JS in this project.

## Benefits of the ES6 Update
We've briefly mentioned that the ES6 update was useful, but let's talk a bit more about why it was such a big deal.

Imagine two laptops, one old and one new, side by side. They're similar enough: they're close in size and shape and can complete many of the same tasks, but the newer laptop has an edge. It is faster and can perform tasks with greater efficiency than the older model.

JavaScript after the ES6 update is like the newer computer. This update included many updates to the syntax, which streamlined the code and made it easier to both read and write. Additional, quality of life improvements were implemented as well, such as adding Python-like generators and `for...of` loops. Even functions were updated and streamlined!
